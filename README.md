# Pterodactyl Panel - Customizable Seeder - Custom nests and eggs initialization

Pterodactyl® is a free, open-source game server management panel built with PHP, React, and Go. Designed with security
in mind, Pterodactyl runs all game servers in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful and intuitive
UI to end users.

Stop settling for less. Make game servers a first class citizen on your platform.

## Why I created this fork

I created this fork because I wanted to have the possibility to initialize the pterodactyle panel with specified nests and eggs. Basically a customizable seeder.
  

### How does it work?

You need to bind the /srv/pterodactyl/seeders directory to you local directory and inside the seeders folder you must have a nests.json containing all the nests you want to create in a json format.

  

Example of nests.json

    
    {
	    "nests": [
	        {
	            "name": "Counter Strike",
	            "description": "Counter Strike servers of various types"
	        },
	        {
	            "name": "Rust",
	            "description": "Rust servers of various types"
	        },
	        {
	            "name": "Grand Theft Auto",
	            "description": "Grand Theft Auto servers of various types"
	        },
	        {
	            "name": "Team Fortress",
	            "description": "Team Fortress servers of various types"
	        },
	        {
	            "name": "Minecraft",
	            "description": "Minecraft servers of various types"
	        },
	        {
	            "name": "The Duel",
	            "description": "The Duel servers of various types"
	        }
	    ]
    }
   

Along with the JSON you need to create the `eggs` directory, that will contain one folder for each nest and inside this folder will be the pterodactyle *JSON* file for the eggs you want imported.

PS: the name of the folder should match the name of the nest on the *nests.json* (but lower case, and separated by dashes).

So the directory structure will look something like this:

    ├── nests.json
    └── eggs/
    ├── counter-strike/
    │ └── egg-counter-strike-global-offensive.json
    ├── minecraft/
    │ └── egg-forge-minecraft.json
    │ └── egg-vanilla-minecraft.json
    └── ...
  */srv/pterodactyl/seeders/ directory*
  
 So for the nest:

    {
       "name": "Counter Strike",
       "description": "Counter Strike servers of various types"
    },

The folder that will hold all the eggs from this nest will be:

    ├── counter-strike/
